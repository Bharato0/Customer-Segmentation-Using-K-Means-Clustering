Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

- This project analyzes customer data from a mall to identify distinct customer segments based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.
- Using the K-Means clustering algorithm, the dataset is divided into 5 clusters, which are then labeled based on behavioral traits such as Careless, Target, Sensible, Spenders, and Average.
- The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, balancing model simplicity and accuracy.
- Clusters are visualized through scatter plots, revealing patterns and helping businesses tailor marketing strategies to specific groups.
- This segmentation provides actionable insights for targeted advertising, loyalty programs, and customer retention efforts.
